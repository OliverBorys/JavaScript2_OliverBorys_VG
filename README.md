## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### **1️⃣ Clone the Repository**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/OliverBorys/JavaScript2_OliverBorys_VG.git
cd JavaScript2_OliverBorys_VG

### **2️⃣ Install Dependencies**
After cloning the repository, navigate to the project folder and install dependencies:

#### **📌 Install Frontend Dependencies**
npm install

#### **📌 Install Backend Dependencies**
cd backend
npm install

---

### **✅ Why This is Important?**
- The **frontend** (`React`) and **backend** (`Express`) are separate, each requiring its own dependencies.
- Running `npm install` in the **frontend** directory installs React-related dependencies.
- Running `npm install` in the **backend** installs Express, SQLite, and other server dependencies.

---

### **🚀 Final Steps to Run the Project**
After installing dependencies, users can start both **frontend and backend**:

#### **Start Backend (`Express + SQLite`)**
cd backend
npm run dev

#### **Start Frontend (`React + Vite`)**
cd ../
npm run dev
